# Python tutorial

This is my code-centric, example-based, description-less and no-bullshit intro to Python for experienced Java (and possible other mature langs) developers.

I'm learning Python for my daughter because I think Java is too difficult to start with programming for kids. Python looks fine, popular and multipurpose language. And for example, with Python we don't have to start with OOP and methods overriding concepts. There are many Python tutorials, but I don't really like them because they require to read many text descriptions, then more text descriptions, and they are focused on the fact that each feature of this lang is great. Well, it isn't, and I'm gonna try to expose the weaknesses too. But anyway, if you already know well Java or another mature language, the code is better than any words. And, I'm learning with code examples, which I'm sharing in this repo.
